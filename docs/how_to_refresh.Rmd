```

> This Guide covers how to:

1. Refresh the dashboard data
2. Update the dashboard login credentials
3. Deploy the dashboard on the [Scotland ShinyApps Server](https://scotland.shinyapps.io/phs-dq-dashboard/)

> Refresh The Data

The dashboard data is refreshed on a monthly basis. The majority of the dashboard data is extracted directly from SMR databases. All of the code that extracts the data is in the `app/code` folder. The Timeliness tab also relies on the expected number of submissions which are published by the Data Monitoring team in their monthly Timeliness Charts.

* Timeliness -- Expected Submissions  
Before every SMR submission deadline the health boards give an estimate of the number of records they expect to submit. 
    + go to the [Timeliness Homepage](https://beta.isdscotland.org/products-and-services/data-management-hospital-activity/smr-timeliness/), download and open the timeliness charts for SMR00, SMR01, SMR02 and SMR04

* Test
Can you run the app? Notice any anomalies in the data? Notice any bugs or glitches in the dashboard functionalities?

> Update the credentials

*username and password get updated every month*

+ open the `create_credentials.R` script located in the `app/admin` folder
+ change the username and password in the script
+ run the `credentials.R` script
+ run the app, check that you can open it with the new credentials

<!-- This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. -->

<!-- When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## Including Plots -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo=FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot. -->
